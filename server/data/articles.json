The question \"How do I lose weight fast?\" gets asked even more. Unfortunately, the so-called answers that pop up are usually ridiculous \"weight loss tips\" that don't actually explain what a person needs to do in order to lose what they don't want and keep it off. What's worse, they often conflict with one another, creating more lasting confusion than lasting results.\n\nThe truth is far simpler. You can lose weight with any number of approaches you may have heard of: IIFYM, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, ketogenic, or intermittent fasting. It's also possible to lose by doing nothing more than eating good food in a moderate amount.\n\nSustainable physique transformation happens by making healthy alterations to your diet, controlling your overall calories (or portions, to think of it another way), and exercising regularly. Any other approach may work in the short term, but will the results last? Don't hold your breath.\n\nHere are Bodybuilding.com's best expert-backed recommendations and how to put them into action!\n\nHow To Lose Weight\nFocus on holding onto or adding muscle, not just burning fat.\nFollow a balanced nutrition plan with consistent eating habits, and track your calorie and protein intake, at least at first.\nAim for 1-2 pounds of loss each week, but not much more.\nExercise at least 60 minutes, 3-4 days per week, with some strength training in the mix.\nPerform cardio workouts or high-intensity interval training 2-3 days per week.\nNow, let's discuss each point in more detail.","img":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/february/the-complete-guide-to-losing-weight-skinny-830x467.jpg","__v":0},{"_id":"5cc0bd7f1241c03c140b54db","title":"Hafthor \"The Mountain\" Bjornsson's 8 Greatest Lift","date":"2019-04-24T19:48:15.058Z","content":"\"Game of Thrones\" articles and videos are as common as crows on a battlefield these days, with the eighth and final season of HBO's fantasy epic just over the horizon. But few if any of them address what, to me, is the most stirring plot development in the last few seasons: Namely, how Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, who plays Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane, has leapt off the screen and become a terrifying, world-dominating force in the real-life sport of strongman.\n\nNo matter if you're a complete newb to Westeros or you're one of those millions of sickos who obsessively watch The Mountain's kill-compilations on YouTube, enjoy this epic draught of epic lifting from the Icelandic warrior himself. In (roughly) chronological order, one for each season of \"GoT,\" here are his greatest feats of strength.\n\n2015: Log Carry, 1,411 Pounds, World's Strongest Viking\n\nCompetitive strongman has a more established connection with history and legend than most strength sports. But this lift, from a time when Bjornsson was the reigning Europe's Strongest Man and had only appeared in one season of \"GoT,\" was especially loaded with mythological heft.\n\nAt the World's Strongest Viking championship in Fefor, Norway, in 2015, Bjornsson carried a re-creation of the mast from a Viking ship for five steps—and was supposedly the first man to do so in 1,000 years, \"as the stories tell.\" But all stories aside, that's a hell of a schlep, and a sign that Bjornsson wouldn't be intimidated by any superhuman challenge.\n\n2017: Weight Over Bar, 100 Pounds, Rogue Record Breaker\n\nWho says strength is all slow, grinding lifts? Anyone who has ever swung a heavy-ass kettlebell can attest that getting the thing up to bellybutton level for a rep or two can feel like a battle for your life. But Bjornsson not only swings this 100-pound bag-bell easily, he launches it well over a 20-foot bar and just short of the mesosphere.\n\nThis is one of those lifts that really brings home just how much I don't want to ever be in a position where Bjornsson feels it necessary to throw me. Or hit me. Honestly, I'm OK with him just staying ignorant to my existence entirely.\n\n2018: Atlas Stone, World's Strongest Man\n\nBjornsson has been so dominant for the last couple of years that it's easy to forget he tried and failed to win the World's Strongest Man seven times starting in 2011, back when he was just 23 and some other dude was playing The Mountain on Season 1 of \"GoT.\"\n\nAfter taking either second or third in six consecutive WSM championships, it seemed inevitable that he would win someday. But it wasn't a sure thing until the final event, the atlas stones, in The Philippines in June 2018. Bjornsson has always handled the frantic head-to-head pace of the atlas stones well, but he was able to stroll to a victory with time to spare.","img":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/april/hafthor-the-mountain-bjornssons-8-greatest-lifts-headerc-830x467.jpg","__v":0},{"_id":"5cc0bda61241c03c140b54dc","title":"Is A \"Refeed\" The Key To Successful Dieting?","date":"2019-04-24T19:49:12.816Z","content":"Dieting can be grueling, inconvenient, and exhausting, especially when you're doing it for weeks or months consistently. But that raises a question: Does it really have to be consistent 24/7 to work? Or is a window of normalcy—maybe not a full-on \"cheat,\" but something more strategic—enough to alter your results one way or another?\n\nIt turns out there's a growing amount of research indicating that dietary \"refeeds\" could be just what you need to get even better results. Refeeds interrupt consecutive days of low-calorie dieting. They are specific, planned days where you eat more food than usual while dieting. But simply eating more may not be enough. Get your extra calories from a specific macronutrient, and you might fare even better.\n\nIntrigued? Hungry? A little of both? Read on.\n\nWhy Refeeds Work\nThere are many reasons, both physiological and psychological, that refeeds can be beneficial, including:\n\nPotentially enhancing fat loss by decreasing some of the body's adaptive responses to chronic caloric restriction\nIncreasing your metabolism, which is essential for long-term fat-loss success\nElevating leptin levels, which decreases your appetite and cravings for food\nProviding a temporary break from your diet, which can help with dietary compliance\nThat last point shouldn't be discounted. I know it's tempting to just try to \"gut it out\"—or tell other people to do so—and try to succeed on willpower when restricting calories. But for many people with weight-loss dreams, this ends up doing more harm than good. Rather than bend their diet just a bit and see it succeed, they end up breaking it entirely.\n\nIs Refeed the Key to Diet Success?\nThere have been a number of studies on the effectiveness of refeeds, but until recently, there weren't any focusing on people who lift weights and want to get leaner. So my lab undertook to study just that, and we presented the findings of our diet refeed study at the fifteenth International Society of Sports Nutrition Annual Conference.\n\nDiet Refeeds Vs. Continuous Dieting\nTwenty-seven resistance-trained men and women were randomly assigned to follow one of two approaches:\n\nA seven-week continuous diet with no diet refeeds\nA seven-week diet that included two consecutive days of maintenance calories per week (usually on the weekends)\nThe continuous diet group reduced their calories by 25 percent below maintenance and were not allowed to deviate from this caloric restriction. So yeah, by the end they were ready to be done!\n\nIn contrast, the diet refeed group was instructed to decrease their caloric intake by 35 percent below maintenance for five consecutive days, and then to increase their caloric intake to their maintenance levels (the same number of calories they were consuming before the diet began) for two consecutive days each week.\n","img":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/march/is-this-refeed-the-key-to-diet-success-header-830x467.jpg","__v":0},{"_id":"5cc0bddd1241c03c140b54dd","title":"Why Every Woman Needs to Lift","date":"2020-01-08T21:55:49.474Z","content":"Dear ladies of all shapes, sizes, backgrounds, and experience levels, I want to start by saying I'm a big proponent of advising women to do whatever the hell they want with their body. Your body is yours. I dislike anybody telling anyone what they're \"supposed\" to be doing for fitness.\n\nSo no, you won't find me giving any advice unrequested. But I'll absolutely answer questions from other women, because I get asked them constantly.\n\nAs a longtime CrossFit athlete, I've been at the receiving end of some vitriolic language. I've been told what I do is stupid, and how I look is wrong. But I've also seen how simply being a muscular woman who is brazen enough to set foot outside of a gym seems to make other women comfortable asking any and all questions related to the human body, and so I've had no choice but to be prepared to respond.\n\nWhy Every Women Needs to Lift\nJust a few of the out-of-the-blue questions that I get on a near-daily basis include:   \n\n\"How do I lose weight?\"\n\"How do I get my arms/shoulders/legs to look like hers/yours?\"\n\"Should I do keto/fasting/whole 30/the cauliflower diet?\"\n\"How do I do a pull-up/deadlift/kettlebell swing/get stronger, period?\"\n\"How should I prepare for my hike in the Andes/walking tour of Barcelona/kayaking trip?\"\n\"How do I get toned?\"\n\"How do I get a bigger butt?\"\nAnd so on. Every woman who lifts could add to the list based on what they've heard. What can I say? Shoulders and biceps are the ultimate conversation starters.\n\nAt first glance, this may look like a wide range of questions, each with a unique and personal answer—but it's not. Deep down, it's all the same question: What's the thing that makes all the other things work better?","img":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/march/why-every-woman-needs-to-lift-1-700xh.jpg","__v":0},{"_id":"5cc0bdff1241c03c140b54de","title":"Ultimate Beginner's Guide to the L-Sit","date":"2019-04-24T19:50:23.203Z","content":"L-sits are one of those exercises that look a lot easier than they are. I mean, holding your legs out in front of you isn't really that hard, is it?\n\nYes, it is.\n\nThe first time I tried this exercise, I thought that maybe my legs were too long and it was just physically impossible for me to do it. Looking back now, it's pretty obvious I simply lacked the abs or the hip flexor strength to do one, but I just didn't know it at the time.\n\nThat's right: abs and hip flexors. L-sits aren't one of those movements where you want to \"turn off\" your hip flexors in order to focus on your abs. These two powerful muscle groups need to play together—with plenty of other muscles—to pull off a solid L-sit. You need core strength, hip flexor strength, shoulder and arm strength, and hamstring flexibility. But once you can cruise through a couple of 30-second L-sits, you'll find that all that strength and flexibility carries over into other lifts and activities, as well. Handstands, lifting, yoga—they're all better with a stronger core, shoulders, and overall muscular coordination.\n\nBut L-sits almost never happen without some work. To build up to the full move, you need the proper series of progressions—or more accurately, regressions—to build up the necessary strength.\n\nKeep in mind this isometric hold can be performed on many different pieces of equipment including parallel bars, parallettes, dumbbells, yoga blocks, a pull-up bar, or even with your hands flat on the ground. When you're first starting out, I recommend using some type of parallel bars to start building the strength necessary to hold your legs parallel to the ground.\n\nTo build up to a full L-sit, train these techniques at least three times a week. Since this exercise requires a tremendous amount of core strength, you might also need more core exercises, such as the V-sit or leg raises, added to your strength training program. Regardless of whether you add more abs to your workout or not, if you follow this simple series of exercises, you'll be rocking this calisthenics staple in no time.\n\nTuck L-Sit\nThe tuck L-sit is a lot easier for beginners because your legs are bent, so your core is holding up a shorter lever. As any physics buff will tell you, the shorter the lever, the less force required to move it, so you don't need as much core strength to hold tucked legs up.","img":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2019/march/beginners-guide-to-l-sits-header-830x467.jpg","__v":0},{"_id":"5cc0be7e1241c03c140b54df","title":"Feel The Bench In Your Chest With This Move!","date":"2019-04-24T19:52:30.959Z","content":"Looking to get strong? I've got bad news for you: The boring stuff is what works. You don't need as much variety or \"muscle confusion\" as you might think to get results. Stick with the basics, follow some semblance of progressive overload, do the work consistently, and good things will happen.\n\nHowever, many trainees—and coaches—fall into the trap of thinking compound movements, and only compound movements, should be utilized 100 percent of the time, no exceptions.\n\nFor one example, because they've been told so often to focus more on their back side, lifters can become so posterior-chain dominant that they lose the ability to recruit their quadriceps. As a result, they don't use enough quads to assist with movements like squats and deadlifts, and often suffer from chronic knee pain.\n\nI've started programming more accessory work like leg extensions and leg presses into the programs of some of my athletes and clients. This is something my 10-years-ago self would have punched my present-self in the face for. But lo and behold, these same athletes and clients have seen improvement in their main lifts, and their knees feel better.\n\nYou'd better believe this can work for the other big lifts, too.\n\nBring It To The Bench\nFrom a personal perspective, my bench press sucks. It's always been an exercise I've struggled with, and there are days I'd rather wash my face with broken glass than head to the gym do it.\n\nSo what did I do to solve this problem? I hammered away at my bench-press technique, implementing accessory movements like paused bench presses and Spoto presses to address my weaknesses. It kinda sorta worked.\n\nBut you know what really worked? To go along with all that technique work, I added some brotastic upper-body isolation work. That's right: Isolation work helped my compound lifts. Why? Because while technique is often the limiting factor in your strength, sometimes it is legitimately a weak muscle group. For me, the chest was that group.\n\nEver since I started including more isolation movements for my pectoral muscles like dumbbell chest flyes, I've seen a nice jump in not only my bench-press performance, but the \"feel\" of the movement too. Here's one movement that made a big difference: the dumbbell squeeze press.","img":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/june/feel-the-bench-in-your-chest-with-this-move-header-830x467.jpg","__v":0},{"_id":"5e14c4721339d007943d6190","title":"Physical fitness linked to better brain function","date":"2020-01-08T21:56:38.823Z","content":"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
